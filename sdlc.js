// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = "This step determines the needs and expectation of a user and document all the requirement. "
const design = "Prepare a plan for a software application while meeting all the requirements"
const implementation = "In this step, actual development starts and the product is built"
const testingAndIntegration = "In this stage, automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs and errors and they deployed"
const maintain = "After the software is released, bugs and issues are solved from time to time."
